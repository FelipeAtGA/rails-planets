# HOMEWORK: RAILS PLANETS!!!

Tonight you'll be making a little baby rails app about PLANETS!!!! It'll be super similar to today's Compliments app lab. Gotta get those reps in!!! ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª

[Here is your planet object!](./planets.rb) Use it wisely...

You'll be creating a bunch of routes & views using this object!

- `/`: Should have a welcome message and a link to the planets page
- `/planets`: Has a list of all the planets! (Don't hardcode this list! Just use the object. [Maybe one of our ruby methods could help...](https://git.generalassemb.ly/wdi-nyc-delorean/LECTURE_U04_D01_Ruby_101#iteration))
- `/planets/:planet`: Returns information about that specific planet
- `/planets/random`: Returns a random planet

### Bonus!!

- Style it up! Flex those flexbox muscles.

## ðŸš€ Completion looks like:

- You have a Rails app in this repo
    - **REMEMBER**: Initialize your rails app using `rails new -G planets`.
- Your rails app has the routes & views described above.

## ðŸš€ Your homework submission should include:

- A pull request created on _this repo_.
- Completion, comfort, wins, losses, questions... you know the drill.

## This homework is due ðŸš¨ 11PM ON THURSDAY NIGHT ðŸš¨
