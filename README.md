# RAILS PLANETS!!!

[Here is the planet object!](./planets.rb)

The objective of this app is to use routes & views using the planet object with the following conditions:

- `/`: Should have a welcome message and a link to the planets page
- `/planets`: Has a list of all the planets! (this list is not hardcoded, just using the object.
- `/planets/:planet`: Returns information about that specific planet
- `/planets/random`: Returns a random planet

### Additionally!!

- Styled up using Flex.

## ðŸš€ Completion looks like:

- I have a Rails app in this repo
    - **REMEMBER**: Initialize your rails app using `rails new -G planets`.
- My rails app has the routes & views described above.
